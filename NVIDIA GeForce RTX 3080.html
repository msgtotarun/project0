            <p>NVIDIA finally let the press pull the actual veil off of their RTX 3080 GPU, after an announcement and
                reveal
                earlier this month, and there is a fair amount to say about it, as is the case with every new generation
                of
                high-end GPUs, and upon careful reviews of multiple outlets that gained access to the card, and thorough
                testing, some themes are consistent all along with the new card. NVIDIA’s new Ampere architecture brings
                about a
                few changes to the landscape of gaming GPU’s, but nothing is groundbreaking, as was understandable after
                the
                2018 launch of ray-tracing. NVIDIA made this generation to improve ray-tracing performance and viability
                above
                all, and it shows.
            </p>

            <h2>RTX Off For The 3080 For a Little Bit</h2>
            Over the course of reviewing “conventional” titles, that is, games that either do not have any path-tracing
            rendering at all, or have it in small part, it was clear that there is a largely incremental gain over the
            previous king of the hill, the RTX 2080 Ti, and even the more comparably-priced RTX 2080 saw around 40%
            performance difference in frame times in 4K resolution. As we turned down the resolution, the gap lessened
            for the most part, as those resolutions are more CPU-bound than GPU. Of course, that also means that you
            don’t
            absolutely have to pair the new 3080 with a top-tier CPU for getting great 4K performance. And with the
            3080,very high graphical fidelity in-game with a 4K output is very much viable now.

            <h2>4K Gaming Is No Longer Niche</h2>
            <p>4K gaming has been a rather “ascended” realm of gaming for the past half a decade, with each flagship
                from
                NVIDIA being tested against the most demanding titles in that resolution to see if it is a playable
                experience with decent, consistent framerates. And with the RTX 3080, incremental improvements have
                finally
                caused that to become a reality in all titles, even games like Red Dead Redemption 2 which are
                notoriously
                heavy on the GPU at such a high resolution. The outlook of 4K gaming is very much what 1440p’s used to
                be a
                few years ago, and with display technology also getting there with higher refresh rates with 4K and so
                on,
                we are very much at the door of that next domain.</p>
