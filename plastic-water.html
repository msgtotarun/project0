            <p>New research conducted at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) lead to the evolution of a
                flame-retardant carbon-fibre-reinforced composite material (CFRP). This plastic molecule is synthesized
                with the help of tannic acid. Tannic acid is a compound that gets converted into carbon when burnt and
                is found in abundance, as it is usually synthesized by plants. The research team also revealed the
                recycling process of the plastic. It is Eco friendly and recycles up to 99% within a couple of minutes.
                Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced plastic is an extremely sturdy and light fibre-reinforced plastic.

            <h2>What is Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic?</h2>
            <p>
                Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics are commonly used in aerospace structures, superstructures of ships,
                civil engineering, and in a lot of consumer and technical applications. These materials are composite in
                nature (i.e. contains a reinforcement and a matrix.) Carbon fibre is the reinforcement of a polymer
                which provides strength and the matrix is the epoxy that holds the reinforcements together. The strength
                and properties of CFRPs vary due to the layout and percentage of the reinforcements used. They are also
                known as graphite fibre-reinforced polymer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Head researcher, Dr Yong Chae Jung said, “We have created a composite material with an expanded range of
                application that is a dramatic improvement over conventional carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic in terms of
                flame-retardancy, mechanical rigidity, and recyclability.” These improved traits are significant in that
                they determine the range of application of said composite material. He further exclaimed, “We will be
                reviewing the structure of this composite material to achieve even further improved properties and to
                further expand the range of its application.”
