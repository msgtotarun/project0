            People all over the world are eagerly waiting for any new signs of hope. Doctors and researchers are working
            towards finding a treatment for COVID-19. In light of this, scientists are now focusing on another part of
            the body: the nose.
            Studies suggest that the virus that causes the illness gains its foothold by infecting certain nasal cells.
            Hence, the nose has come forward as an important aspect while finding a treatment for COVID. According to an
            article published on Science News, preventing this nasal invasion might be powerful enough to change the
            course of the pandemic.
        </p>

        <h2>What professionals who study the nose say</h2>
        <p>
            There are no such therapies so far, but people who study the nose bring fresh perspectives about the early
            stages of COVID-19. Scientists are developing ways to prevent the virus from settling into the nasal cavity.
            Some of these include a nose spray that smothers and inactivates a key viral protein. Disinfectants that are
            commonly used before sinus surgeries and dilute baby shampoo misted up the nose are also among the various
            alternatives being tested by doctors.

            Andrew Lane is an otolaryngologist and rhinology specialist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He says he
            is a nose person, but to most people noses don’t usually capture a lot of interest. Now it has become the
            centre of everyone’s attention. “The nose is a place where the virus is setting up shop,” Andrew Lane
            explained.
        </p>

        <p>In a recent study, he and his colleagues measured levels of a protein on human cells known as ACE2. It is
            thought to be one of the ways the virus can infect the cells. A collection of tissues were taken from the
            noses and throats of people. The upper back part of the nasal cavity, which is known as the olfactory
            epithelium, was packed with ACE2. This spot is also where the small cells are located. Note that symptoms of
            COVID-19 include loss of smell.</p>
