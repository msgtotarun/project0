                While we did not see any instances of the “one more thing” routine in the Apple event held this past
                week,
                which would be followed by the announcement of the new iPhone, Apple still did not give reason to many
                to
                sleep on this event this time. Apple has been very direct with letting developers know what they may
                expect
                to see improve or get added to their repertoire to realize the full potential of their products. And
                this
                September event it was no different, with the iPad Air rounding off the whole show, and deservingly so,
                for
                it brings with it landmark features for developers of Apple apps to use and develop with.

                iPad Air Brings Neural Engine With 2x The Cores
            </h2>
            <p>
                The iPad Air was the vehicle for the flurry of new and the most major changes. The new A14 Bionic chip
                introduced in it has a 16-core neural engine which greatly enhances the experience of Apple’s
                newly-introduced Core ML. Apple’s documentation overviews this new addition, and it offers a whole host
                of
                supported frameworks, also developed by Apple, for developers to implement in their applications. Vision
                is
                a Computer Vision framework that lets applications perform landmark detection, facial detection, and
                other
                image tracking features, for example.
                More abilities brought on by Core ML include (rather clearly named) functions such as Natural Language
                that
                enables NLP (Natural Language Processing) as part of Core ML, Speech for converting audio to text, and
                Sound
                Analysis for identifying sounds in recorded audio. Core ML itself utilizes Apple’s existing Accelerate
                framework and its BNNS library to great effect to achieve the results Apple expects it to do when
                developers
                get to try it.
