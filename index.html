                <h1>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Makes Ray Tracing at 4K Finally Viable – Review Roundup</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    NVIDIA finally let the press pull the actual veil off of their RTX 3080 GPU, after an
                    announcement
                    and
                    reveal earlier this month, and there is a fair amount to say about it, as is the case with every
                    new
                    generation of high-end GPUs, and upon careful reviews of multiple outlets that gained access to
                    the
                    card,
                    and thorough testing, some themes are consistent all along with the new card. NVIDIA’s new
                    Ampere
                    architecture brings about a few changes to the landscape of gaming GPU’s, but nothing is
                    groundbreaking, as
                    was understandable after the 2018 launch of ray-tracing. NVIDIA made this generation to improve
                    ray-tracing
                    performance and viability above all, and it shows.

                <h1>iPad Air (2020)- Apple Brings Even More Power To Developers With Core ML and Revamped Neural Engine
                </h1>
                <hr>
                <p font>
                    While we did not see any instances of the “one more thing” routine in the Apple event held this past
                    week, which would be followed by the announcement of the new iPhone, Apple still did not give reason
                    to many to sleep on this event this time. Apple has been very direct with letting developers know
                    what they may expect to see improve or get added to their repertoire to realize the full potential
                    of their products. And this September event it was no different, with the iPad Air rounding off the
                    whole show, and deservingly so, for it brings with it landmark features for developers of Apple apps
                    to use and develop with.
